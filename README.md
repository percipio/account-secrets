## Account Secrets is a Replacement for Account Questions

Instead of answering the recovery questions with the truth, obfiscate with the answers from the ones from the app.

# Example

Your bank asks: "What's your mother's maiden name?" 

You go to the app and select your bank's question and the app gives you a different question

It says: "What color was your first car?"

You enter "Blue" (obviously the real color of your car)

And then enter that in the bank's input field
